## A simple card game with betting

---

### The rules

  - Two cards are dealt face up, a third card is dealt face down.
  - Bet what you want. If the third card is between the other two, you get double your bet.
  - If the third card matches with one of the other two cards, you get three times your bet.
  - But if the third card falls outside the other two cards, then the bet is lost !
